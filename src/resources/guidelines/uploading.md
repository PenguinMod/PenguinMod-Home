# Project Uploading & Updating guidelines
Most of these rules do not affect projects uploaded before May 25th, 2023, unless those projects get updated.

The only rules that can affect existing projects are "Use other platforms sparingly", "Copyright", and "Projects with a messaging feature".

## Important Note
These guidelines only apply to PenguinMod's project sharing.

If you are packaging your project for release on other websites,
you should still follow their rules.

Also, let us know of any necessary changes we should make by talking to us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NZ9MBMYTZh)
or making an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/PenguinMod/PenguinMod-Home/issues).

### Spam
Do not just upload the same project multiple times.
To update a project you can either:
- Click on the Update button on the Upload page, and click on any project.
- Go to the My Stuff page on the Home page and click the 3 dots on any project. Then click Edit Project.

If you keep uploading the same project multiple times, you wont be able to post projects for a day or more
(depending on if you already got punished for it).

If you keep doing this, you wont be able to post projects for a day or more
(depending on if you already got punished for it).

### Base requirements for a project
Uploading empty or default projects will get your project rejected.
Please do not do this multiple times as your account will be limited if we see you doing this.

Projects that are based around using an iframe to display other websites or projects will be rejected.
This is a rule because the only purpose of this is to show content that is not yours or can be viewed anyways in your browser.
*(This may not apply to projects uploaded before October 6th due to communication issues.)*

### Projects uploaded that were shared on Scratch (Scratch Reuploads)
If you are just taking a Scratch project that was shared on Scratch and uploading it onto PenguinMod, please note the following:

- The PenguinMod version must have a change in the code (ex: changing a costume would end up being rejected still)
- The code change should be meaningful (ex: a bug fix not in the Scratch version wouldn't count as a meaningful change)

This means like something extra should have been added, or something important in the project was changed like a gameplay difference or added difficulty.

If you are not following any of the above changes:
- The PenguinMod project can have changes planned later (in this case, the above rules would be considered after you have updated the project)

### PenguinMod Forks / Mods
If your project only works outside of PenguinMod, don't upload it to our site.
All PenguinMod projects should actually work on PenguinMod, we don't want to approve something that crashes the site instantly.

*(Note for developers: If we get a lot of projects uploaded from your mod that don't work on PenguinMod, we'll likely end up blocking your site from the API. See [here for details](https://github.com/PenguinMod/penguinmod.github.io/blob/develop/FORKING.md).)*

### Be respectful to others.
Your project cannot contain any derogatory terms (slurs).
You will likely get banned for posting a project with these.

Be respectful of any real-world events that harmed others in any way.
(ex: don't make fun of people who were affected, or don't make a comedic version of the event)

You cannot make reference to discrimination or discriminate of certain things like:
- Age
- Race
- Religion
- Sexual Orientation
- Gender & Pronouns
- Disabilities

You cannot make reference to:
- Terrorism
- Suicide
- Death Threats

### Keeping others safe
Your project should not put others in danger. General rules for this are:
- You cannot force others to download malicious material or link them to malicious material.
- You cannot threaten others in any way.
- You cannot use their general location without full consent. If you need to, you can just put a pop-up asking if you can use their location, with a simple Yes and No button.
- You cannot ask others for their full name, password on any site, phone number, email address, or legal details.
- You cannot take pictures of others without full consent.

Faking personal information (ex: showing a fake IP address) should be noted in the project itself or the project's notes.

Downloading malicious material may be an executable application or DLL that contains spyware, malware, ransomware, etc.
Your account will be instantly banned and you may be reported to the Scratch Team or security services if your project does this.

### Use other platforms sparingly.
If you are linking to a seperate Discord or site anywhere on your project (including iframes),
your actions on that site (or the site itself if it is not a major platform) must not endanger others
or display content to them that is only appropriate for certain ages.

External sites also cannot be scams or information-stealing websites.

Ideally, external links should follow all rules here wherever they can.

### Projects must be safe for people 13 and under.
Swearing is allowed, but you shouldn't swear too much (ex: not every 2 sentences, not more than 2 swear words per sentence).

If your project contains blood, it must have a warning somewhere at the start of the project
and in the project instructions.

Sexual content cannot be included at all in your project, including references to sexual material such as genitals or pornographic websites.

### Limits on Blood and Violence
You cannot display:
- Realistic or real-world depictions of extreme gore, graphic violence, or death
- Animal abuse and torture (realistic or not)
Blood also cannot be realistic and human bodies/skeletons should be used lightly (do not have more than 1 in a scene).

### Drugs, alcohol and illegal material
You cannot display or encourage others to take drugs, drink alcohol, or vape.

You cannot display illegal content (anything that breaks the law in the U.S.)
or encourage others to commit crimes or do anything against those laws.

You cannot encourage others to use real-life guns or explosives.
You also cannot:
- Encourage or make reference to shooting living things in real life
- Encourage or make reference to shooting buildings in real life

### Money
You cannot sell products for real money inside your project.

You **can** however, link to Patreon or Shopify.
Let us know of any other sites we can allow if you need them.

### Copyright
Any company or business reserves the right to take down your project if they believe it violates their copyright.
We will also remove your project if it contains pirated content or material.

Reasons your project might be removed are:
- Including logos or designs without their owner's explicit permission
- Using other peoples artwork or music without their explicit permission

If you are a company or individual and believe your copyright has been violated, [please check contact methods here.](https://studio.penguinmod.com/contact.html)

### Preventing or Removing access to parts of the site
You may not remove or prevent access to any part of the project or website.

If the moderators can not access the project and its contents from within the site, it will be removed.

Examples of what you can not do:
- Removing or preventing the use of the "See Inside" button
- Removing or preventing the use of the "File" menu
- Removing sprites, costumes or sounds if the project is opened

### Limits on Audio
If any audio clips in your project are past the top of the audio preview in the Sounds tab,
moderators are allowed to mute/remove those sounds or reject your project.

This also applies if you are using multiple audio clips to play loud/unpleasant audio.

If you do want to use loud audio, you must display a warning screen that the user must interact with to continue.
Stating loud sounds are in the project using the title, instructions or notes is not sufficent.

### "Chatroom" Projects or Projects with a messaging feature
Your project **MUST** have moderation.

If you cannot moderate your project properly, it will be removed.

Your messaging feature cannot allow users to:
- Use a user-uploaded profile picture (unless you can moderate them so they follow above guidelines wherever they apply)
- Attach images, video or any media (unless you can moderate them so they follow above guidelines wherever they apply)
- Link to any websites (unless you can moderate them so they follow above guidelines wherever they apply)
- Break any of the rules in the "Be respectful to others" section

Moderation concepts that you may use:
- Filtering bad words using a blacklist or API
- Using an AI to reject messages or content that is against the guidelines (though this should be mixed with other moderation strategies)
