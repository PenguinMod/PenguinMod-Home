# PenguinMod Moderation Expectations
These guidelines define exactly how you should handle interacting with projects, the website, and users.
Please read ***the entire document*** to understand everything about moderation.

## I am a PenguinMod user, not moderator
Please see the [Uploading Guidelines](https://penguinmod.com/guidelines/uploading), you ***will only receive update notifications for the Uploading Guidelines***, not the moderator guidelines.
This document will not serve much of a purpose to non-moderators and will refer to many moderator-only aspects of the website, meaning you cannot do most of the things listed.

## Our expectations
When moderating PenguinMod, we expect you to handle conflicts, disagreements, spam, etc with a mature and formal fashion.
If you are talking to users, please use English with minimal spelling mistakes or weird grammar (acronyms, onomatopoeias, etc) to make sure the messages can be translated properly across most languages. ***Avoid*** using weird formatting (markdown), hyperlinks (URLs), or unnecessary symbols in your messages as well.

Profanity (curse/swear words) or inappropriate messages ***will not be tolerated.***

On top of this, ***do not do anything that intentionally creates problems for the PenguinMod team.***
This means abusing the moderation tools we give you or intentionally hitting usage limits to cause harm to a project, user, or the platform.

## What if another moderator is breaking the rules?
Do not punish them yourself unless you feel it is necessary.
Let the moderator know what they are doing wrong, only involve others if needed.

If you think you need to let more people know about the moderator, please also let another staff member know like a developer, and we will try to handle it accordingly.

## How this document is formatted
Most things here are listing punishments for a rule offense in bullet points. Text not in bullet points is just general info or adding to each point.

The bullet points will contain the punishments for the amount of times a rule was broken, so 1st offense (1st), 2nd offense (2nd), 3rd or more (3rd+)

Multiple rules are also included in other rules as they may have the same punishments or notes as another rule.

# Punishment reasons + Moderator Messages
These are rules for how you should write both punishment reasons and moderator messages.
These still apply in the section for "How you should use Moderator Messages."

When you are talking to users, please use English with minimal spelling mistakes or weird grammar (acronyms, onomatopoeias, etc) to make sure the messages can be translated properly across most languages. ***Avoid*** using weird formatting (markdown), hyperlinks (URLs), or unnecessary symbols in your messages as well.
Do ***NOT*** ban a user with something like "you know why" or "check (url here) for info."

Avoid including identifying information in your messages, including usernames like "moderator John here," or "Best regards, - John." It's possible that bad actors can use these names to tell which moderators they should mess with, or just give you a bad reputation in general.

Avoid sounding condesending or forceful when it's not necessary, like a small rule offense.
Profanity (curse/swear words) or inappropriate messages ***will not be tolerated.***

When discussing things like gore, violent content, or sexual content, avoid giving specific details on what the content is.
It's appropriate to say things like:
- "the content is too violent"
- "the content depicts or encourages suicide"
- "the content is too sexual for PenguinMod"

but *do not* give details like:
- "the characters are being stabbed with extremely gory blood and their lungs are flying out of their body"
- "the two characters are having sexual intercourse"

# How you should use Moderator Messages
You are only allowed to use the messaging system for the following purposes:
- Replying to user's disputes about moderation actions on their projects
- Correcting a large mistake in a previous message that would otherwise cause confusion on the user's end
- Warning a user after they have done several false reports (see the Punishing reports section)
- Warning a user if they have a bad username or profile picture (see the Bad usernames and Bad PFPs sections)
- Answering a user's question ***if they have explicitly requested the response of a moderator.***

Any inappropriate usage of the messaging system is not allowed, if you are not sure if a usage is not allowed then feel free to ask.

Do ***NOT*** mention/use any other platforms within your mod messages. Having conversations go off-site can be inappropriate or legally questionable in some cases, regardless of context. Examples that break this rule are "can we continue this over discord" or "check/use this url." An exception to this rule is restating original messages that already talked about the platform. An example of the exception would be if they messaged you "why cant i show that *twitter* link," and you restate the question like, "you cant show that *twitter* link because it contains sexual content."

# Stance on sharing moderation actions
Moderators themselves should not make any moderation actions public.
Do not share to others why a user was banned, why a project was removed, etc.
The only case this is allowed is if the user you are mentioning it to already has knowledge about the moderation action, and it can't be a case where they "might know" or you only have a theory that they know.

Users can share their moderation actions anywhere, and as stated above you can message them about these actions if they are asking why they got moderated.
However, you shouldn't allow a moderation message for something inappropriate to be shared again.

# Test Accounts
These accounts are exempt from *most* punishment as they are used by developers or automatically used for testing:
- PenguinMod
- PenguinBot
- PenguinJam
- JeremyGamer13
- ianyourgod

Specifically, unless you see one of these accounts uploading NSFW, gore, or anything of the sort, don't do anything to them.

# What punishments do I give for violating the Uploading Guidelines?
## Base requirements for a project + Projects that display websites (iframes) + PenguinMod Mods / Forks
For the iframe rule, the project must actually be based around iframes.
- Hard Delete the project and use the quick reject for these.

## Credit + Spam / Project updates + Projects uploaded that were shared on Scratch (Scratch Reuploads)
Projects reuploaded from Scratch ***should NOT be punished*** under this rule if they are from the same creator.
Reuploads of other people's projects from Scratch should contain a note that the original creator allowed them to upload it from Scratch. If the actual creator or someone involved states they did not allow it, remove the project under this rule anyway.

# Punishing reports
You do not need to punish false reports unless there are more than 3 within the same couple of days, and are from the same person.
A false report would be reporting a project or user that does not get close to breaking the actual site rules, you ***should NOT*** punish people who aren't sure if their report is against the rules or are badly written (since we have kids on the site) (ie, "this project might be offensive" or "idk if this is too bad" etc)
- No punishment without meeting the above requirements

# Troubleshooting
## I cannot access one of the features mentioned!
Please let someone with higher perms know, and do the highest punishment you have access to if you can't do the listed one.
## One of the mentioned features does not exist!
Please let a developer know on Discord, it's possible it is broken at the moment or we just didn't get around to adding it properly.
