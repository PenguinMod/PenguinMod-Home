## What is a Game Jam?
How our PenguinJam will work is:

### We will reveal a theme
You need to create a PenguinMod project based on a theme.

You can make a game that relates to the theme we give you in any way. **It should be a big part of your game's design.**

### Submit a project
You need to upload your theme-related project to PenguinMod **using the tag #penguinjam2 in the title or notes.**

Make sure to upload your projects by ***December 24th at 2:00 PM (Eastern Time)***! Do not upload them any later than that.

### We will rank your projects
Staff members and developers will go through all of the published projects and check out what everyone did with the theme.

The more creative your interpretation of the theme is, the better.

However, your games **still need to be fun to play in general.**

### We will give out rewards
We will choose the top 5 games, and the best creators will get badges!

Badges will be awarded over time. **Please do not pressure us into giving your badge ASAP as we might be busy with other things.**
