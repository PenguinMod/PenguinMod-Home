## What is a Game Jam?
How our PenguinJam will work is:

### We will reveal a theme
You need to create a PenguinMod project based on a provided theme.

You can interpret the theme in any way, and implement it into your published game. **It should be a big part of your game's design.**

***Projects that do not fit this theme will not receive any rewards.***

### Submit a project
You need to upload your theme-related project to PenguinMod **using the tag #pjamspring25 in the title or notes.**

Make sure to upload your projects by ***May 4th at 2:00 PM (Eastern Time)***! Do not upload them any later than that.

### Judging projects
Staff members and developers will go through all of the valid published projects. We will be reviewing the projects based on the following criteria:
Presentation: The quality of costumes and sounds.
Originality: How new is the concept of the game?
Entertainment: How fun and/or interesting the game is to play.
Incorporation: How well does the game implement the theme?

*Note: These criteria are not final; if you have something special to bring to the table then we might give you a higher score.*

### We will give out rewards
We will choose the top 5 games to be our winners, and they will receive badges displayed on the website profile!

Badges will be awarded over time. **Do not pressure the team into giving your badge ASAP. Please acknowledge that we may and will be busy with other things.**
