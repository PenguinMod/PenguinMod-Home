# The Theme is: Consuming Power!
Upload your project before June 22nd @ 12 PM EST
Remember to include your team’s tag in the notes and credits!
- [#pjamhero](/search?q=%23pjamhero) - Superheroes
- [#pjamvillain](/search?q=%23pjamvillain) - Supervillains

Suit up for another PenguinJam!

This time, you’ll choose a side. Will you defend justice or plunge the world into chaos?
When uploading your project, use the following tag:
- [#pjamhero](/search?q=%23pjamhero) - Superheroes
- [#pjamvillain](/search?q=%23pjamvillain) - Supervillains

(Note: only use one tag, or you will be considered teamless and your score will not count toward a team’s total score!)

Create a game for both you and your team’s glory!

As always, the top 5 projects will earn special rewards. At the end of the jam, each team’s project scores will be combined, and the side with the highest total score will unlock a special badge displayed on your profile.

## What is a Game Jam?
How our PenguinJam will work is:

### We will reveal a theme.
You need to create a PenguinMod project based on a provided theme. 

You can interpret the theme in any way, and implement it into your published game. **It should be a big part of your game's design.**

***Projects that do not fit this theme will not receive any rewards.***

### Submit a project
You need to upload your theme-related project to PenguinMod **using the tag #pjamhero or #pjamvillain in the title or notes.**

Make sure to upload your projects by ***June 22nd at 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time***! Do not upload them any later than that.

***Projects under both tags will not receive any rewards.***

### Judging projects
Staff members and developers will go through all of the valid published projects. We will be reviewing the projects based on the following criteria:
- Presentation: The quality of costumes and sounds.
- Originality: How new is the concept of the game?
- Entertainment: How fun and/or interesting the game is to play.
- Incorporation: How well does the game implement the theme and the supernatural? 

*Note: These criteria are not final; projects may not be specifically judged by the listed criteria.*

### Rewards

We will choose the top 5 games in ***each team*** to be our winners, and they will receive badges displayed on the website profile!

Badges will be awarded over time. **Do not pressure the PenguinMod team into giving your badge ASAP. Please acknowledge that we may and will be busy with other things.**
